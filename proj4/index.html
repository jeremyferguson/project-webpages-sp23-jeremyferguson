        <p>In this project, I implemented a spring model for simulating cloths, collision models to allow cloths to interact with other objects and itself realistically, and shaders to show different materials on the cloths. It was really interesting to implement the collision parts, as there was a lot more to it than I would have initially thought. I also felt that the movement simulation was quite simple, and I was really impressed by how much realism was achievable with a relatively simple model.</p>

    <p>In this part, I implemented the buildGrid method, which builds a grid of point masses and springs. My main debugging hurdle here was that I was dividing by w and h instead of num_width_points and num_height_points, which led to some weird results initially. Other than that, I had no issues.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        In this part, I implemented simulation methods to allow for simulating external and spring forces on the cloth. Additionally, I implemented a constraint where the spring would never exceed 10% of its length, to prevent excessive stretching of the cloth.
        I found this part a bit difficult to debug, as I had several areas of uncertainty with the spec that I had to test and see which one gave the intended result.
    </p>

            Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
            To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again.
            You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Changing the spring constant changes how much the cloth will stretch. As it gets low, the cloth is able to stretch out more, and as it gets high, the cloth stretches out less. This can be seen in the screenshots below.

        Similarly to ks, changing the density changes how much the spring will stretch. The denser it is, the more gravity will affect it, so the lower it will drag. This can be seen in the screenshots below.

    <p>
        Damping affects how much the cloth bounces around on its way to coming to a rest state. When damping is low, it will oscillate a lot, and when it is high, it will not oscillate at all. However, if all other parameters are equal, the rest state will look the same for all damping values.

        The higher the spring constant, the fewer folds there are. This is because the higher spring constants mean that there is more force between different parts of the cloth and the cloth is stiffer and harder to bend.

    <p> In this part, I implemented a model that allowed the cloth to deal with self-collision. I also found this a bit tricky because I initially had problems with the cloth clipping through at later points in the simulation, despite seeing it handle self-collision in early collisions. I figured out that this was because the corrections were too small, so I changed my calculations of the correction forces to allow for larger correction forces, which seemed to do the trick.</p>

        With a lower density, the cloth is less affected by gravity and forms fewer folds on the way down. This also occurs with a higher spring constant, as the cloth will bend less for the same amount of force, so it ends up being stiffer.

    </a>
    <p>In this part, I implemented several shaders to highlight different material properties on the cloth. This was hard to debug because there were no useful error messages, just runtime errors. However, there was overall not much code to write, so it never ended up being too much of a pain.</p>

            Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.

    <p>
        A shader program is a program that calculates color values for points along an object, in accordance with some material properties. The vertex shader calculates color values for each vertex, and the fragment shader calculates for smaller shapes within the object, or fragments.

            Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.
            Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The Blinn-Phong shading model computes the shading values at the vertices and interpolates across the rest of the mesh using those vertex values. This shading includes an ambient color which exists regardless of light, a diffuse component which emits light relative to what angle the surface is to the light it receives, and a specular component which reflects light mostly in the same direction it came from.

    <p>
        With small values for height, the diffrence between displacement and bump shading is mostly noticeable around the edges, as you can see on the bump mapping that it looks like a sphere, whereas the displacement map has pointier edges.
